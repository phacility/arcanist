/**
 * Models a directed graph in a generic way that works well with graphs stored
 * in a database, and allows you to perform operations like cycle detection.
 *
 * To use this class, seed it with a set of edges (e.g., the new candidate
 * edges the user is trying to create) using @{method:addNodes}, then
 * call @{method:loadGraph} to construct the graph.
 *
 *   $detector = new ExamplePhabricatorGraphCycleDetector();
 *   $detector->addNodes(
 *     array(
 *       $object->getPHID() => $object->getChildPHIDs(),
 *     ));
 *   $detector->loadGraph();
 *
 * Now you can query the graph, e.g. by detecting cycles:
 *
 *   $cycle = $detector->detectCycles($object->getPHID());
 *
 * If ##$cycle## is empty, no graph cycle is reachable from the node. If it
 * is nonempty, it contains a list of nodes which form a graph cycle.
 *
 * NOTE: Nodes must be represented with scalars.

Publish accepted revisions after review. This command is the last step in the
standard Differential code review workflow.

To publish changes in local branch or bookmark "feature1", you will usually
run this command:

  **$ arc land feature1**

This workflow merges and pushes changes associated with revisions that are
ancestors of __ref__. Without __ref__, the current working copy state will be
used. You can specify multiple __ref__ arguments to publish multiple changes at
once.

A __ref__ can be any symbol which identifies a commit: a branch name, a tag
name, a bookmark name, a topic name, a raw commit hash, a symbolic reference,
etc.

When you provide a __ref__, all unpublished changes which are present in
ancestors of that __ref__ will be selected for publishing. (With the
**--pick** flag, only the unpublished changes you directly reference will be
selected.)

For example, if you provide local branch "feature3" as a __ref__ argument, that
may also select the changes in "feature1" and "feature2" (if they are ancestors
of "feature3"). If you stack changes in a single local branch, all commits in
the stack may be selected.

The workflow merges unpublished changes reachable from __ref__ "into" some
intermediate branch, then pushes the combined state "onto" some destination
branch (or list of branches).

(In Mercurial, the "into" and "onto" branches may be bookmarks instead.)

In the most common case, there is only one "onto" branch (often "master" or
"default" or some similar branch) and the "into" branch is the same branch. For
example, it is common to merge local feature branch "feature1" into
"origin/master", then push it onto "origin/master".

The list of "onto" branches is selected by examining these sources in order:

  - the **--onto** flags;
  - the __arc.land.onto__ configuration setting;
  - (in Git) the upstream of the branch targeted by the land operation,
    recursively;
  - or by falling back to a standard default:
    - (in Git) "master";
    - (in Mercurial) "default".

The remote to push "onto" is selected by examining these sources in order:

  - the **--onto-remote** flag;
  - the __arc.land.onto-remote__ configuration setting;
  - (in Git) the upstream of the current branch, recursively;
  - (in Git) the special "p4" remote which indicates a repository has
    been synchronized with Perforce;
  - or by falling back to a standard default:
    - (in Git) "origin";
    - (in Mercurial) "default".

The branch to merge "into" is selected by examining these sources in order:

  - the **--into** flag;
  - the **--into-empty** flag;
  - or by falling back to the first "onto" branch.

The remote to merge "into" is selected by examining these sources in order:

  - the **--into-remote** flag;
  - the **--into-local** flag (which disables fetching before merging);
  - or by falling back to the "onto" remote.

After selecting remotes and branches, the commits which will land are printed.

With **--preview**, execution stops here, before the change is merged.

The "into" branch is fetched from the "into" remote (unless **--into-local** or
**--into-empty** are specified) and the changes are merged into the state in
the "into" branch according to the selected merge strategy.

The default merge strategy is "squash", which produces a single commit from
all local commits for each change. A different strategy can be selected with
the **--strategy** flag.

The resulting merged change will be given an up-to-date commit message
describing the final state of the revision in Differential.

With **--hold**, execution stops here, before the change is pushed.

The change is pushed onto all of the "onto" branches in the "onto" remote.

If you are landing multiple changes, they are normally all merged locally and
then all pushed in a single operation. Instead, you can merge and push them one
at a time with **--incremental**.

Under merge strategies which mutate history (including the default "squash"
strategy), local refs which descend from commits that were published are
now updated. For example, if you land "feature4", local branches "feature5" and
"feature6" may now be rebased on the published version of the change.

Once everything has been pushed, cleanup occurs. Consulting mystical sources of
power, the workflow makes a guess about what state you wanted to end up in
after the process finishes. The working copy is put into that state.

Any obsolete refs that point at commits which were published are deleted,
unless the **--keep-branches** flag is passed.

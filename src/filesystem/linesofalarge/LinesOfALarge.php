/**
 * Abstraction for processing large inputs without holding them in memory. This
 * class implements line-oriented, buffered reads of some external stream, where
 * a "line" is characterized by some delimiter character. This provides a
 * straightforward interface for most large-input tasks, with relatively good
 * performance.
 *
 * If your stream is not large, it is generally more efficient (and certainly
 * simpler) to read the entire stream first and then process it (e.g., with
 * `explode()`).
 *
 * This class is abstract. The concrete implementations available are:
 *
 *   - @{class:LinesOfALargeFile}, for reading large files; and
 *   - @{class:LinesOfALargeExecFuture}, for reading large output from
 *     subprocesses.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *   foreach (new LinesOfALargeFile('/path/to/file.log') as $line) {
 *     // ...
 *   }
 *
 * By default, a line is delimited by "\n". The delimiting character is
 * not returned. You can change the character with @{method:setDelimiter}. The
 * last part of the file is returned as the last $line, even if it does not
 * include a terminating character (if it does, the terminating character is
 * stripped).

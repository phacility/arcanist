    Deprecating UIActionButton (Part 1)

    Summary: Replaces calls to UIActionButton with <ui:button>.  I tested most
             of these calls, but there were some that I didn't know how to
             reach, so if you are one of the owners of this code, please test
             your feature in my sandbox: www.ngao.devrs013.facebook.com

             @brosenthal, I removed some logic that was setting a disabled state
             on a UIActionButton, which is actually a no-op.
